# Prodigy-Cyber-Security-
Caesar-Cipher

This is a simple Python program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
Overview

The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a certain amount (the key). It is a type of symmetric encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd caesar-cipher

Run the Python script:

python caesar_cipher.py

    Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message.

Features

    Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
    Choose the shift value (key) for encryption or decryption.
    Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
    Simple and easy-to-understand command-line interface.

Examples

Encrypting a message:

Enter 'e' for encrypt or 'd' for decrypt: e
Enter the message to encrypt: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypt message: Khoor, Zruog!

Decrypting a message:

Enter 'e' for encrypt or 'd' for decrypt: d
Enter the message to decrypt: Khoor, Zruog!
Enter the shift value: 3
Decrypt message: Hello, World!
